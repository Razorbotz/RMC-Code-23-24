Main page for RMC Code for the 2023-2024 school year.  This will serve as the parent repository to hold both the ROS2 and C++ submodules.

The C++ repository holds the client-side GUI used to control the robot, contained in the robotcontrollerclient2 folder.  The remaining code is either various bits of test code that remain from years past or is legacy code I haven't gotten around to looking at and making sure that it can be deleted.

The ROS2 repository holds multiple years of code in it.  The skinny folder contains the code written for the skinny robot that was built from 2019-2021.  The spinner folder contains the code from the robot built for the 2021-2022 school year.  The scoop folder contains code written for the bot built for the 2022-2023 school year. The documentation for the ROS2 files can be viewed in the Documentation folder in the RMC-Code-23-24 repository.
